# Preface to napari segmentation 

## Background

In the 1st half of 2022, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Imaging Tech team and a cohort of imaging scientists came together to develop learning materials for napari. Specifically, these learning materials were designed for research biologists *without any Python or coding experience*, and intended to onboard said users onto napari so they could perform a cell segmentation workflow using a curated set of plugins hosted on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org).
