If you've arrived on this Jupyter Book, that means you likely have an interest in **cell biology, imaging analysis**, and all the applications of the [**open-source napari platform**](https://www.napari.org)! By following this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to perform cell segmentation within napari, and all that with *only minimal coding* or use of a command prompt/terminal.

While accessible to everyone, these materials have been created with research **biologists, microscopy**, and **experimental design** in mind.
