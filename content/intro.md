If you've arrived on this Jupyter Book, that means you likely have an interest in **cell biology, imaging analysis**, and all the applications of the [**open-source napari platform**](https://www.napari.org)! By following this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to perform cell segmentation within napari, and all that with *only minimal coding* or use of a command prompt/terminal. 

:::{note}
While anyone can follow along, this course has been created with **research biologists, microscopy**, and **experimental design** in mind. If you have a broader interest in napari, we invite you to browse the range of uses for the platform [here](https://www.napari.org/gallery.html), as well as the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.com).
